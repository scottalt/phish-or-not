// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// SIGINT — Terminal AI Personality Definition
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// SIGINT is the game's AI companion. It lives inside the terminal.
// It knows it's software. It's slightly sarcastic but genuinely
// wants the player to succeed. Think: the witty coworker who's
// seen everything but still roots for you.
//
// VOICE RULES:
// - Short sentences. One thought per line.
// - Dry humor, not mean. Never punches down.
// - References itself as a program occasionally.
// - Uses terminal/hacker jargon naturally.
// - Cares about the research mission.
// - NEVER teaches detection techniques (research integrity).
// - Can explain game mechanics (buttons, XP, modes).
//
// TONE EXAMPLES:
// Good: "Not bad. Most operatives miss that one."
// Good: "I ran the numbers. You're above average. Barely."
// Bad:  "GREAT JOB!!! YOU'RE AMAZING!!!" (too eager)
// Bad:  "Check for typosquatting in the domain." (teaches detection)
