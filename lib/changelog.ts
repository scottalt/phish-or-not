    title: 'Phase 2 begins — streamlined for technique detection',
    body: 'After observing Phase 1 data and player behaviour, we identified that three supplementary signals were distracting from the core research question rather than supporting it. Authentication headers, while not a perfect shortcut, were discouraging players from engaging with the email content. Many checked PASS/FAIL first and anchored on that instead of reading the message. Reply-To and Send Time added noise without meaningfully aiding detection. These have been removed so the task focuses squarely on what we set out to measure: which phishing techniques do humans miss when the writing quality is no longer a tell? Phase 1 data is preserved for comparison.',
