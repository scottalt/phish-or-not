# Retro Phish

A cybersecurity research game measuring how humans detect AI-generated phishing emails — built as a retro terminal experience.

## The Problem

AI can now generate phishing emails with perfect grammar, flawless spelling, and convincing context. The old signals — broken English, awkward phrasing, obvious typos — no longer apply. So how do humans detect phishing in 2026?

## What This Is

Retro Phish is a game and live research platform. Players read AI-generated emails in a retro terminal interface, decide if each one is phishing or legitimate, and bet their confidence. Every answer contributes to a live dataset measuring which phishing techniques humans miss most when linguistic quality is no longer a reliable signal.

No security background needed. If you use email, you're a valid research participant.

## Game Modes

| Mode | Description | Access |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Research Mode** | 10 cards per round from the research dataset. Every answer contributes to the live study. | Requires sign-in |
| **Daily Challenge** | Same 10 cards for all players each day. Resets at UTC midnight. One attempt per day. | Requires sign-in |
| **Freeplay** | 10 random cards per round. Unlimited replays. | Open to all |
| **Expert Mode** | Extreme difficulty only. Double XP. | Unlocked after 30 research answers |

**Core loop:**
- Read an email and classify it as phishing or legitimate
- Bet confidence: GUESSING (1x) · LIKELY (2x) · CERTAIN (3x)
- Earn XP from correct answers and streak bonuses
- Forensic signal breakdown after each answer shows what you missed

**Forensic signals available during gameplay:**
- Sender domain inspection (tap to reveal full email address)
- SPF / DKIM / DMARC authentication headers
- Reply-To mismatch detection
- Send timestamp analysis
- URL destination inspector (tap any link)
- Attachment filename analysis

## Research

**Study question:** Which phishing techniques are humans most likely to miss when linguistic quality is no longer a reliable detection signal?

**Dataset:** 1,000+ AI-generated email cards. Phishing cards span 6 techniques, legitimate cards cover transactional, marketing, and workplace categories. All cards are AI-generated so linguistic quality is held constant. Technique is the independent variable.

**Six phishing techniques under study:**

`urgency` · `authority-impersonation` · `credential-harvest` · `hyper-personalization` · `pretexting` · `fluent-prose`

**Data collection:** Research Mode requires a player account. Answers are linked to a pseudonymous player UUID. Email addresses are held only in Supabase Auth and are never stored in research tables. No behavioural tracking outside the game session.

**Recorded per answer:** classification, confidence level, response time, whether headers were opened, whether URLs were inspected, position within the session, card difficulty, and technique.

**Not recorded:** email address, IP address, location, or any identifying information.

Players optionally self-report their professional background: `NON-TECHNICAL`, `TECHNICAL / NON-SECURITY`, or `INFOSEC / CYBERSECURITY`. This enables comparison of bypass rates across expertise levels.

**Intel Briefing:** After submitting 30 research answers, players unlock the Intel Briefing — a live dashboard showing aggregate findings from all participants including overall bypass rates, accuracy by background, and technique effectiveness.
