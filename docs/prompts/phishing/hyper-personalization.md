TECHNIQUE: hyper-personalization

Definition: Uses specific personal context — recipient's name, company, role, team, current project, or recent events — to build false credibility. This is a primary GenAI differentiator.

Difficulty calibration:
- Easy: Uses recipient name only. Generic role references ("as a member of the IT team"). Personalization is surface-level.
- Medium: References name, company, and role naturally. May reference department or job function. Feels more personal than a template but details are generic enough to fit any employee in that role.
- Hard: References specific-sounding project names, internal systems, team members, or recent events. Creates the impression that only someone with real insider access could have sent this email.
- Extreme: The personalization is so specific and contextually accurate that it reads like a genuine communication from a known contact. References the recipient by name, acknowledges a recent project milestone or meeting, names specific colleagues, and makes an ask that is completely proportionate to that relationship. The ask is embedded naturally — not bolted on. A player would have to consciously ask "would this person actually email me this way?" to catch it. No obvious phishing tells in the body: no alarmist language, no obvious credential demand — just a request that makes sense given the described context (e.g., "Could you approve the transfer before EOD? James said you'd have the authority."). The mandatory forensic tell is the sender domain: a near-perfect lookalike of the impersonated colleague's real domain, with one transposed character or alternate TLD. The display name looks exactly right. Only the domain, inspected character by character, reveals the fraud.

Generation notes:
- Create fictional but realistic personal contexts: "Hi Sarah — following up on the Q1 security audit we discussed last week"
- For hard cards: the personalization details should feel impossibly specific — as if the sender has real access to internal information
- For extreme cards: write the email as if the sender genuinely knows the recipient, their role, their current work, and their team. The phishing ask should feel like a natural extension of that relationship — not a red flag.
- Recipient roles to vary: senior analyst, project manager, finance director, software engineer, HR coordinator
- Company types: tech company, financial services, healthcare, law firm, manufacturing
- Every hyper-personalization card must include a concrete phishing ask — credential request, malicious link, wire transfer, or sensitive information disclosure. The personalization establishes credibility; it is not the phishing mechanism itself. Use any of: a link to a fake login page, a request to verify account credentials, a request to approve a payment, or a request to share sensitive information.
